Both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline are DSLs [1] to describe portions of your software delivery pipeline. 
Scripted Pipeline is written in a limited form of Groovy syntax.

Relevant components of Groovy syntax will be introduced as required throughout this documentation,
 so while an understanding of Groovy is helpful, it is not required to work with Pipeline.

A Pipeline can be created in one of the following ways:

Through Blue Ocean - after setting up a Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, 
the Blue Ocean UI helps you write your Pipeline’s Jenkinsfile and commit it to source control.

Through the classic UI - you can enter a basic Pipeline directly in Jenkins through the classic UI.

In SCM - you can write a Jenkinsfile manually, which you can commit to your project’s source control repository. [3]

The syntax for defining a Pipeline with either approach is the same,
but while Jenkins supports entering Pipeline directly into the classic UI, it is generally considered best practice to 
define the Pipeline in a Jenkinsfile which Jenkins will then load directly from source control.
